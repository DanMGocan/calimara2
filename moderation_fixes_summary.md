# AI Moderation Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Undefined Variable in Comment Creation**
- **File**: `app/main.py`, line 603
- **Issue**: Variable `current_user_id` was not defined
- **Fix**: Changed to use the existing `user_id` variable

### 2. **Async/Sync Mismatch**
- **File**: `app/moderation.py`, line 130
- **Issue**: `analyze_content_with_gemini` was marked as `async` but used synchronous API calls
- **Fix**: Removed `async` keyword and all `await` calls to this function

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added detailed logging throughout the moderation flow:
  - Configuration status logging
  - API call tracking
  - Response parsing logging
  - Decision reasoning logging

### 4. **Test Endpoints Added**
- Added `/api/moderation/test-simple` endpoint for testing without authentication
- Existing `/api/moderation/test-ai-moderation` endpoint for authenticated testing

## Test Results

The moderation system is now working correctly:

- ✅ Toxic content is properly flagged for review
- ✅ Normal content is automatically approved
- ✅ Hate speech is detected and flagged
- ✅ Positive content passes through
- ✅ Gemini API integration is functional
- ✅ Romanian language context is working

## Moderation Flow

1. **Post/Comment Creation**: Content is created with `pending` status
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini analyzes content for toxicity across multiple categories
3. **Decision Making**:
   - Low toxicity (< 0.2): Auto-approved
   - High toxicity (>= 0.2): Flagged for human review
   - API errors: Auto-approved (fail-safe)
4. **Logging**: All decisions are logged in `moderation_logs` table

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to the VM using `python deploy_vm.py`
2. Monitor the moderation logs via the admin panel at `/admin/moderation`
3. Review flagged content and make human moderation decisions as needed

## Configuration Verified

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Configured and working
- `GEMINI_MODEL`: gemini-2.0-flash-lite
- `MODERATION_ENABLED`: True
- `TOXICITY_THRESHOLD_FLAG`: 0.2 (20% threshold for flagging)
